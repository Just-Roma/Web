This little web page intends to create an attractive neon background, the idea is based on this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lJKcxmsT2c.
The channel is called MG1010 if the link does not work.

All files except RunMe.html represent different parts(modules) of the page.
RunMe.html combines all together and is just a spare file for the case the NeonBubbles.html does not work properly. Unfortunately it increases the loading time.

Just use this link to open it:

Or this one:
